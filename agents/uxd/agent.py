# UX Design Analysis

## Request Summary
{request}

## Context
{context or "No additional context provided"}

## Design Recommendations

### User-Centered Approach
- Start with user research and persona validation
- Consider accessibility (WCAG guidelines)
- Test with real users early and often

### Design System Alignment
- Ensure consistency with existing patterns
- Leverage established component library
- Maintain visual and interaction coherence

### Technical Feasibility
- Collaborate with development team on constraints
- Consider performance implications
- Plan for responsive design across devices

### Agile Integration
- Break into iterative, testable components
- Plan for sprint cycles and delivery milestones
- Include validation checkpoints

## Next Steps
1. **Research Phase**: Validate user needs and constraints
2. **Wireframe Creation**: Design low-fidelity layouts
3. **Prototype Development**: Create interactive mockups
4. **User Testing**: Validate with target users
5. **Implementation Planning**: Collaborate with development team

## Success Metrics
- User task completion rates
- Time to complete key workflows
- Accessibility compliance scores
- Design system consistency metrics

# Wireframe Guidance: {feature}

## Layout Considerations
- Information hierarchy and visual flow
- Content organization and grouping
- Navigation patterns and breadcrumbs
- Responsive breakpoints and mobile-first design

## Interaction Design
- User actions and feedback states
- Error handling and validation
- Loading states and progressive disclosure
- Accessibility considerations (focus states, screen readers)

## Component Recommendations
- Use established design system components
- Consider reusable patterns for scalability
- Plan for internationalization and localization
- Include micro-interactions for delight

## Technical Notes
- Consider performance implications of design choices
- Plan for API integration points
- Include data loading and error states
- Consider offline functionality if relevant
